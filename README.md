<br>This is my first iOS app for my Code Fellows assignment which includes:
<br>-A Button which displays text when tapped
<br>-A Switch which takes the user to Second View
<br>-A Slider which shows a number when used
<br>-A second slider which displays text when used
<br>-A second view screen with a button + segue
